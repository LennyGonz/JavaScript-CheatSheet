# Understanding JavaScript Concepts

## Execution Context - Thread of Execution - Global Memory - Call Stack

There are two halves to the process of executing code

1) the ability to walk through the code line-by-line → known as the thread of execution <br> All that is, is the ability to take line one → execute it, line two → execute it, and so on. <br> It's threading its way down our code (top → bottom) <br>
2) Simultaneously, the other part that's required to run our code is a place to store the bits of data that we announce as we go through our codes global execution context, which is the global memory.

So to reiterate,when Javascript code is run, the thread of execution reads each line of code. Line-by-line and when it reads each line it also saves everything in global memory:
  - function definitions
  - variables
  - etc...

And when it reads a line where a function is invoked, Javascript creates a `local execution` context that keeps track of the variables/constants used inside the function block known as `local memory`.
```js
const num = 3;
function multiplyByTwo(inputNumber){
  const result = inputNumber * 2;
  return result;
}

const output = multiplyByTwo(num);

const newOutput = multiplyByTwo(10);
```

Multiple functions can be invoked, so how does Javascript keep track?

Using a call stack.

Always in the call stack is global, so when there are no more functions left on the call stack, it returns back to global.

In the example above, our call stack would push `multiplyBy2(num)` → create an execution context (return result) → pop `multiplyBy2(num)` off the stack 

Then push `multiplyBy2(10)` onto the call stack → create an execution context (return result) → pop `multiplyBy2(10)` off the stack and return to global

## Promises

#### Fulfillment

One day, I fulfill that promise. It makes you so happy that you post about it on Twitter!

#### Rejection

One day, I tell you that I can't fulfill the promise

You make a sad post on Twitter about how I didn't do what I had promised.

Both scenarios cause an action. The first is a positive one, and the next is a negative one.

Keep this scenario in mind while going through how Javascript `promises` work.

#### When to use a promise

Javascript is a synchronous. It runs from top to bottom. Every line of code below will wait for the execution of the code above it

But when you want to get data from an API, you don't know how fast you will get the data back. Rather, you don't know if you will get the data or an error yet,

Errors happen all the time, and those things can't be planned. But we can be prepared for it.

So when you're waiting to get a result from the API, your code is blocking the browser.
It will freeze the browser. Neither we nor our users are happy about that at all!

Perfect situation for a `Promise`!

#### How to use a Promise

Now that we know that you should use a `Promise` when you make Ajax requests, we can dive into using `Promises`. First, I will show you how to define a function that returns a `Promise`. Then, we will dive into how you can use a function that returns a `Promise`

```js
function doSomething(value){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Fake a API call
    setTimeout(() => {
      if(value) {
        resolve(value)
      }
      else {
        reject('The value was not truthy')
      }
    }, 5000)
  })
}
```

This function returns a `promise`. This `promise` can be resolved or rejected

Like a real-life promise, a `promise` can be fulfilled or rejected

#### Use a function with a promise

Using a function that returns a `Promise`

```js
doSomething().then((result) => {
  // Do something with the result
}.catch(error){
  console.error('Error message: ', error)
})

// Use a return Promise with Async/Await

(async () => {
  let data = null
  try {
    data = await doSomething()
    // So something with the result
  } catch(error) {
    console.err('Error message: ', error)
  }
})();
```

#### XMLHttpRequest Synchronous

Before async Javascript was a thing, we used XMLHttpRequest(XHR) to call an API to get data without refreshing our page

The XHR is event-based. So when we used to make an AJAX call, all the code below the call had to wait until we got our response back from the server (aka synchronous). **Our Javascript was blocking all the other code.**

If we got back an error, instead of the response we expected, then the errors in our Javascript became huge:

```javascript
function AJAX(url, cb) {
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open("GET", url, false);
  xhr.send(null);

  if (xhr.status === 200) {
    console.log(xhr.responseText);
    cb(xhr.responseText)
  }
}
AJAX('https://api.github.com/users/github', function(data){
  console.log('AJAX', data)
})
```

#### Fetch: making promises based asynchronous AJAX requests

The Fetch API is a new, more powerful replacement of the XHR - fully async and Promise based

```js
fetch('http://example.com/movies.json').then(function(response) {
  return response.json()
})
.then(function(myJson){
  console.log(JSON.stringify(myJson))
})
```

Fetch makes more sense, since you can read in order which steps it takes

#### Async/Await

```js
(async () => {
  const resp = await fetch("https://api.github.com/users/github");
  const jsonData = await resp.json();
  console.log("jsonData: ", jsonData);
})();
```

To use `await` with the `Fetch`, we have to wrap it in a `sync` fuction
In this case, we wrapped it in an IIFE *(Immediately Invoking Function Expression)*

When the fetch has returned a `Promise` the first time, the result is put in the `const resp`, so the next variable waits until the fetch gets a response. The console is only outputting data whn the `jsonData` variable has got the data.
